# Another Layer 1

Among the major trends of thinking in the blockchain space is the idea of maximalism. In the blockchain context, maximalism is the belief that there exists an already developed blockchain, most often Ethereum or Bitcoin, that is already capable of handling all potential use cases that require blockchain and that efforts to create new “layer 1” blockchains are pointless and perhaps even counterproductive.

A major trend in blockchain is the idea of maximalism. Maximalism is the belief that an already-developed blockchain, most often Ethereum or Bitcoin, can handle all potential use cases, and that new “layer 1” blockchains are pointless or counterproductive.

At Topl, we reject maximalism for two reasons: the current age of blockchain technology and the technical realities of such infrastructure-level technologies.

Blockchain technology was introduced, as the first implementation of a value-bearing network without a central authority, in 2008 with the Bitcoin whitepaper. By comparison, the first algorithms and programs for artificial intelligence and machine learning were written in the 1950s and 1960s. Despite this 60-plus-year history, dominant frameworks for AI and machine learning, such as Caffe and Tensorflow, were only developed in 2013 and 2015. By a similar token, Facebook belongs to, at a minimum, the fourth generation of social media, preceded in dominance by AIM, Friendster, and MySpace. Facebook is still facing increasingly robust competition from newer platforms, such as TikTok. At the same time, Google only came to the market after other search engines such as Lycos, Infoseek, AltaVista, Ask Jeeves, and Yandex had launched.

As we look at these other technologies with equally challenging engineering requirements and network effects to blockchain, we can conclude that any expectation that a first or even second generation blockchain network represents the culmination of an entire technology movement has taken a dramatically shortsighted view of innovation.

While this first argument may leave open the possibility that at some time in the future there will be a singular blockchain network, the technical requirements and contradictions imposed on blockchain technology make the emergence of a single maximal blockchain extremely unlikely even once web3 is "mature".

While this first argument may leave open the possibility that at some future time there will be a singular blockchain network, the technical requirements and contradictions imposed on blockchain technology make the emergence of a maximal blockchain impossible rather than merely postponed to the future.

Embedded in any infrastructure technology are a number of inescapable tradeoffs that must be made, security versus cost and throughput versus decentralization being among the most significant. So long as the problems being addressed by blockchain technology remain diverse, there will remain no single correct choice on any two opposing characteristics. An application such as stock trading may demand absolute maximization of transaction throughput while peer-to-peer lending would benefit greatly from maximized decentralization.

In fact, the notion of maximalism is also proven flawed by the plans of the blockchain with the most maximalists: Ethereum. Central to the design of Eth2, the ongoing upgrade to the Ethereum network, is the concept of shards. Similar to Polkadot “parachains” or Cosmos’s “zones,” Ethereum shards can be nearly classified as independent blockchains that merely embody a common communication protocol and may share validators or other crypto-economic infrastructure.

Having rejected the idea of maximalism and developing our own layer 1 blockchain network, we recognize that it is incumbent upon Topl to provide an answer to the question of interoperability, “if there are going to be multiple blockchains, how will they still interact?” and to offer a vision of value accrual in our blockchain economy.

Having rejected the idea of maximalism and answered the question what is blockchain uniquely suited for, we turn to _Topl's blockchain thesis_ and answer how Topl has developed an opinionated blockchain with a focus on certain early use cases.

Based on the blockchain USP of disintermediated trust and direct inclusion, we believe that _any market or value chain that currently lacks trust, infrastructure, and existing standards, especially those with highly heterogeneous actors_ can be considered ideal candidates for blockchain adoption.

!!! note

    We can think of networks as being more heterogeneous if they're composed of actors of greatly varying sizes, different entity types (private companies, NGOs, governments, etc), and situated in different legal jurisdictions.

The above characterization fits supply chains, especially those originating in the Global South, carbon markets, and the Cambrian explosion of ESG claims exceedingly well.

As carbon neutrality and ESG claims grow in popularity, incentives increase for greenwashing and similar practices. Trust and verifiability for these claims will become paramount. At the same time, the global diversification of the economy means that more and more business is continually done in or involving parts of the world with legal and regulatory systems quite literally foreign to us, and where traditional means of dispute settlement may not be feasible.

* 32% of Fortune 500 companies have committed to carbon neutrality ([as of October 2020](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/climate-targets-of-fortune-500-companies/))
* 80% of consumers report being more likely to purchase from a company with strong ESG practices ([via PWC](https://www.pwc.com/us/en/services/consulting/library/consumer-intelligence-series/consumer-and-employee-esg-expectations.html))
* 85% of investors surveyed report considering ESG data in their investment decisions ([via Gartner](https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/the-esg-imperative-7-factors-for-finance-leaders-to-consider))
* Between 2016 and 2050, the share of global GDP accounted for by the US and the EU is expected to fall from 31% to 21% as economic growth shifts further toward emerging markets ([via PWC](https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/research-insights/economy/the-world-in-2050.html)).
