# Motivation and Vision

Challenging problems require unique solutions. The greatest problems require even more: unique solutions that are purpose-built and relentlessly dedicated to their resolution. Our current economy has severe shortcomings and demands the latter.&#x20;

Today’s economy is defined by

* an extreme lack of transparency and accountability for practices that may be damaging to the environment or communities
* precarious inequality built through the overcompensation of capital investment relative to productive contribution
* monetary fundamentals exacerbating rather than mitigating the above economic characteristics

Topl imagines a new economy, one designed to make growth simultaneously inclusive and sustainable, one that aims to include social and environmental concerns previously cast out as “externalities.”

A unique and purpose-built public network, the Topl Blockchain, will serve as this envisioned foundation. This protocol has been informed, from core architecture to ancillary tooling, by a relentless focus on matters of inclusivity and both economic and environmental sustainability. Critically, we do not envision Topl as only being “the blockchain for ESG” or the “blockchain for impact”, in the vein of countless startup pitch taglines of “Uber for X”, relegating itself to a niche existence. Rather, Topl is designed to underpin a broad range of economic activities, including supply chains, trade finance, energy production, payments, commodities, and carbon markets, and do so in such a way that these economic activities are transformed to naturally produce greater positive impact and inclusion.
