# Services and dApp Development

As web3 is still in its early days, Topl realizes that many of its users do not have the means to interact with its blockchain network directly or develop their own dApps to do so. In order to unlock this demand and help accelerate adoption and ecosystem growth, Topl is actively developing several open-source services and dApps of its own accord. Over the coming months, Topl will organize the teams building and promoting these services and dApps into an independent entity that will play a central role in the growth of the Topl ecosystem.

This organization, presently referred to as Topl Solutions, is currently focused on developing services and dApps across 3 different areas:

* **Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS).** Built for those wishing to integrate with the Topl Blockchain without the need to deploy and maintain their own nodes or infrastructure _(launched Q2 2021)_;
  * BaaS is further divided into two components: **Torus**, providing users with the ability to write to and query the Topl blockchain using RPC API exposed by Topl nodes; and **Genus**, enabling structured queries and streams of blockchain data;
* **Lattice, Traceability-as-a-Service.** Topl's blockchain is ideally suited to deliver supply chain traceability and transparency. Lattice is designed to help businesses to track the provenance of their goods as well as provide verifiability for sustainability and labor claims _(launching Q3 2022)_;
* **Registry-as-a-Service (RaaS).** In line with Topl's vision to drive the monetization of impact and ESG, Topl Solutions is developing a registry-as-a-service platform to enable organizations to more easily, transparently, and interoperably mint carbon credits (as well as other forms of impact claims) via the Topl Blockchain _(launching Q4 2022)._
